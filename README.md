## Fair ML Project: Description
I’m in the process of creating a predictive model using the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) data set, a tool used to predict offender recidivism. By gaining an understanding of COMPAS’ shortcomings, I hope to build an interactive dashboard that sheds light on predictive model bias.

I wrote a research paper titled “Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System” that touched on this topic and serves as the foundation of this project. This paper can be found on my website http://www.bintualkassoum.com
