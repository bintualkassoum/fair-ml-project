## Project Description
I’m in the process of creating a predictive model using the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) data set, a tool used to predict offender recidivism. By gaining an understanding of COMPAS’ shortcomings, I hope to build an interactive dashboard that sheds light on predictive model bias.

I wrote a research paper titled “Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System” that touched on this topic and serves as the foundation of this project. This paper can be found [here](https://github.com/bintualkassoum/fair-ml-project/blob/main/Algorithms%20in%20the%20Criminal%20Justice%20System.pdf).

No additional packages need to be installed, as we used `Pandas` and `Numpy`, both of which are pre-installed on Google Colab. 

For additional information regarding package and library installations via Google Colab, please see [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bebi103a/bebi103a.github.io/blob/master/lessons/03/packages_and_modules.ipynb).
