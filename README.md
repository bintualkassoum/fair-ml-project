## Project Description
I’m in the process of creating a predictive model using the Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS) data set, a tool used to predict offender recidivism. By gaining an understanding of COMPAS’ shortcomings, I hope to build an interactive dashboard that sheds light on predictive model bias.

I wrote a research paper titled “Algorithms in the Criminal Justice System” that touched on this topic and serves as the foundation of this project. This paper can be found [here](https://github.com/bintualkassoum/fair-ml-project/blob/main/Algorithms%20in%20the%20Criminal%20Justice%20System.pdf).
